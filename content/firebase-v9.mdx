- So you have **Sucessfully** Created your new firebase project.

## Firebase `Firestore`

Firestore is a cloud database that can be handled from your application. When using firstore firebase magically updates your app UI so that you don't have to manage manually. You will mostly use `Firestore` for `Crud` oparations.

### Setup Firestore in Firebase

- From the build dropdown in the sidebar click on **Firebase Database**. ![](/image/posts/firebase-v9/6.png)
- Then create your Database. ![](/image/posts/firebase-v9/7.png)and Continue with **Test mode**, then selet your Database location and click **Enable**. ![](/image/posts/firebase-v9/8.png)
- Now the `firestore` is Sucessfully setup.

### Setup Client with Next.js

You can visit firestore documentation on [Firestore Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart). Make sure to have a NEXT.js application if not then follow the instructions [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).
Open your terminal in the project root dictionary & run the following.

```bash
npm install firebase@9.17.2 --save
```

Then create a new file named `firebase.js` in the project root dictionary.
Add the following...

```jsx title="firebase.js"
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

// TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase project configuration
// See: https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592
const firebaseConfig = {
  FIREBASE_CONFIGURATION,
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// Initialize Cloud Firestore and get a reference to the service
const db = getFirestore(app);
```

If you don't have a configuration then goto the console of your project in firebase and Create a new **Web Application** to get your firebaseConfig.

Now to `Add data to Firestore` from your client...

```jsx
// Add a second document with a generated ID.
import { addDoc, collection } from "firebase/firestore";

try {
  const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, "users"), {
    first: "Alan",
    middle: "Mathison",
    last: "Turing",
    born: 1912,
  });

  console.log("Document written with ID: ", docRef.id);
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Error adding document: ", e);
}
```

Then to `Read data` from your collection...

```jsx
import { collection, getDocs } from "firebase/firestore";

const querySnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, "users"));
querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
  console.log(`${doc.id} => ${doc.data()}`);
});
```
